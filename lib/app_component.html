<h1> How it works</h1>

<material-dropdown-select
        [buttonText]="ctrl.value"
        [ngFormControl]="ctrl"
        [error]="errorMsg"
        [options]="options"
        [listAutoFocus]="false"
        (blur)="onBlur($event)"
        (focus)="onFocus($event)"
></material-dropdown-select>
Dropdown touched: {{ctrl.touched}}

<h2>What I would expect</h2>
<h3>Touched is on focus lost blur - not on focus gain</h3>
<material-input [ngFormControl]="ctrl2"></material-input>
Input touched: {{ctrl2.touched}}
<br><br>
<button (click)="reset()">reset</button>


<br><br>
<br><br>
<h1>Those 2 values should be bound bidirectional as its error state is affecting presentation except value</h1>

<h3>Type somethin in and than remove it with backspace</h3>


<material-input [ngFormControl]="ctrl2"></material-input>

<material-input [ngFormControl]="ctrl2"></material-input>



<h2>I would expect those to act the same as</h2>

<material-input [(ngModel)]="tempVal" [required]="true"></material-input>

<material-input [(ngModel)]="tempVal" [required]="true"></material-input>

<h3>Obviously "touced" state is not shared thus we must first toch both fields</h3>
